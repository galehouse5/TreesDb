How to disable license check temporarily for development environment:
- deobfuscate "Aspose.Cells.dll" using de4dot to "Aspose.Cells-cleaned.dll"
- open "Aspose.Cells-cleaned.dll" using a decompiler
	- open the Aspose.Cells.License class
	- this class invokes another class internally that maintains license state, go to it's definition
	- find the method that indicates if the license is valid, this should be internal, static, and return an enumeration type
- run "ildasm.exe" from "Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio"
	- open "Aspose.Cells-cleaned.dll"
	- dump to "Aspose.Cells-reassembled.il"
- open "Aspose.Cells-reassembled.il" with a text editor
	- remove public key signature to prevent exception when loading modified assembly
		- e.g. ".publickey = (00 24 00 00 04 80 00 00 94 00 00 00 06 02 00 00   // .$.............." (spans 10 lines)
	- correlate the method found using decompiler with the IL code by using nearby string literals as a reference for searching the IL code
	- change all branches within this method to return the enumeration value that indicates a valid license
		- e.g. "IL_004a:  ldc.i4.0" is changed to "IL_004a:  ldc.i4.1"
- run "ilasm.exe /DLL Aspose.Cells-reassembled.il" to generate "Aspose.Cells-reassembled.dll"
- rename "Aspose.Cells-reassembled.dll" to "Aspose.Cells.dll" and reference it in Visual Studio project
	- avoid invoking Aspose.Cells.License.SetLicense as it is now redundant and will actually throw an exception, due to a redundant license check that does remain enabled
